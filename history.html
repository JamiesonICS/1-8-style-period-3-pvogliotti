    <h1>The Start of Primus</h1>
    <p>Primus was first formed in El Sobrante, California, made of up Bassist, and Vocalist Les Claypol, Guitarist Todd Huth, and Drummer Jay Lane in 1984. After about a month Originally when Claypool and Huth had formed the band they went by the name of Primate and were joined by a LinnDrum drum machine as they had not found a drummer yet, and kept using it until Claypools friend Vince "Perm" Parker had returned from a stint at the military, where Claypool, Huth, and Parker would record the bands first demo together which Claypool had funded by selling his car. After about a month of Primate, they were contacted by a group called The Primates who threatened to sue over their simular names, where they then changed their name to Primus. Parker was soon replaced by Peter Libby who first played the demo tape recorded under the name of Primus. In the years to come Peter Libby was replaced by Robbie Beand, who also was replaced Tim "Curveball" Wright in 1986.</p>
    <p>By 1988, Primus was getting pretty popular, selling out Berkeley Square where they would then use recording from 2 of their shows there for their live album "Suck On This" with it releasing the album in 1989. In december of 1989 The group first went into the studio to form their First studio album "Frizzle Fry" where they would get the attention of big record labels, where they would end up signing with Interscope Records in 1991. With Interscope Records They would release their biggest albums yet being "Sailing the Seas of Cheese", "Pork Soda", and "Tales from The Punchbowl" featuring their most famous tracks like "Jerry was A Racecar Driver", "My Name is Mud", and "Wynonas Big Brown Beaver".</p>
    <p>After their success, Primus decided to go on hiatus which was more like the band had broken up, since they weren't speaking to each other anymore. However in late 2003 Primus reunited with Alexander to make a 5 track EP. Which lead to Primus eventually making <i>"Green Naugahyde"</i>, <i>"Primus & The Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble"</i>, and <i>"The Desaturating Seven"</i></p>
